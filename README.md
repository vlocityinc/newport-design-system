## Tasks

Install [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) globally:

```bash
npm install --global gulp
```

### `npm start`

Start the Lightning Design System preview app.

### `gulp lint`

Lint the code base for syntax and stylistic errors.

```bash
# Lint indentation, Sass, JavaScript files
gulp lint

# Lint languages independently
gulp lint:sass
gulp lint:js
gulp lint:js:test
gulp lint:spaces
gulp lint:html
gulp lint:vnu (optional: --component "{trees_base_with*,trees_base_deep*}")
```

### Compilation

### `npm run build && npm run dist`

Generate the Lightning Design System into the `.dist` directory.

### `gulp styles`

Compile Sass to CSS into `.dist/assets/styles`.

### `gulp clean`

Delete temporary build and local files.

### Stats

`npm run stats`: Useful stats about the project's deliverables.

### Tests

`npm test`: run all tests

## Troubleshooting

### npm and Node.js

The Vlocity Newport Design System uses `npm` to manage dependencies. Please [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org), and try running `npm install` again.

If Node.js is already installed, make sure youâ€™re running v6 or up.

### JavaScript and compilation issues

JavaScript dependencies sometimes get out of sync and inexplicable bugs start to happen. Follow these steps to give a fresh start to your development environment:

1. The installed `npm` version must be at least v3.10. You can update your npm with: `npm install npm -g` (`sudo` may be required).
2. Re-install dependencies: `rm -Rf node_modules && npm install`
3. `npm start`

If this did not work, try running `npm cache clean` and repeat the above steps.
