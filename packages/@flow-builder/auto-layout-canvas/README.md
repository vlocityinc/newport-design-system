# Canvas

The Canvas is the part of the editor dedicated to displaying the flow elements and handling events received from interacting with that display.

This package contains the Canvas API. The API will handle coordination with the editor and other parts of the builder in response to interaction events.

The Canvas API is to be consumed by a UI component that is responsible for rendering the flow elements and passing interaction events to the API.

For more information on the Canvas see its [documentation](https://salesforce.quip.com/3nsDAM8bCodc)
